# Data-Science-for-business
# HR Analytics

This Jupyter notebook contains a Python script for HR Analytics. The script uses various Python libraries to perform data analysis and modeling.

## Libraries Used

- `numpy`: Used for scientific computing and handling large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
- `pandas`: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- `itertools`: Provides various functions that work on iterators to produce complex iterators.
- `matplotlib`: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- `gridspec`: A module from matplotlib that specifies the geometry of the grid that a subplot can be placed in.
- `mtick`: A module from matplotlib that provides a ticker locator and formatter classes for both scalar and date data.
- `imblearn`: Provides methods to handle imbalanced datasets.
- `SMOTE`: A class from imblearn used for over-sampling the minority class.
- `sklearn`: A machine learning library for Python.
- `SimpleImputer`: A class from sklearn used for completing missing values.
- `tree`: A module from sklearn that includes decision tree-based models.
- `DecisionTreeClassifier`: A class from sklearn that implements a decision tree classifier.
- `train_test_split`: A function from sklearn to split arrays or matrices into random train and test subsets.
- `LabelEncoder`: A class from sklearn used for encoding labels with value between 0 and n_classes-1.
- `classification_report`: A function from sklearn that builds a text report showing the main classification metrics.
- `accuracy_score`: A function from sklearn that computes the accuracy classification score.
- `confusion_matrix`: A function from sklearn that computes confusion matrix to evaluate the accuracy of a classification.
- `roc_curve`: A function from sklearn to compute Receiver operating characteristic (ROC).
- `auc`: A function from sklearn to compute Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC) from prediction scores.
- `f1_score`: A function from sklearn to compute the F1 score, also known as balanced F-score or F-measure.
- `pydotplus`: An improved version of pydot for graphing Python data structures.
- `seaborn`: A Python data visualization library based on matplotlib.
- `IPython.display`: A module from IPython that provides classes for displaying various types of outputs.
- `Image`: A class from IPython.display that can display images.
- `make_pipeline`: A function from sklearn that constructs a Pipeline from the given estimators.
- `XGBClassifier`: An implementation of the scikit-learn API for XGBoost classification.
- `LogisticRegression`: A class from sklearn that implements logistic regression.
- `GaussianNB`: A class from sklearn that implements the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm for classification.
- `SVC`: A class from sklearn that implements the support vector machine classifier.
- `RandomForestClassifier`: A class from sklearn that implements a random forest classifier.
- `VotingClassifier`: A class from sklearn that implements a majority-voting ensemble classifier.

## Usage

To use this notebook, open it in Jupyter and run the cells in order. The notebook will perform data analysis and modeling on a HR dataset.
